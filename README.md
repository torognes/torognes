## Hi

- I’m working on improving the tools [VSEARCH](https://github.com/torognes/vsearch) and [Swarm](https://github.com/torognes/swarm) for microbiome bioinformatics.
- I’m often thinking about new ideas for how we can use clever algorithms and data structures to improve bioinformatics tools.
- I'm teaching the course [IN4030](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN4030/index-eng.html) *Introduction to bioinformatics* at the University of Oslo every spring semester.
- I'm also involved in various projects at Oslo University Hospital (OUS), including [Publika](https://publika.no), a publication database for OUS.
